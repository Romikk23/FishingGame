In general, it is a simple fishing, where there is a rod with which you can go to the lake and catch fish there. At the beginning of the map there is a guide who will introduce you to the game. Next, you will need bait, which you can buy for coins or get if you survive the day and go to the lodge to sleep. The house is located in the lower left corner of the map. In the morning, someone will put a jar of worms under your door.

## Gameplay ##

**Rods**

  There are two types of fishing rods, <img src="https://github.com/Romikk23/FishingGame/blob/main/game/src/main/resources/textures/hud/inventory_items/10.png" width="16" > wooden and <img src="https://github.com/Romikk23/FishingGame/blob/main/game/src/main/resources/textures/hud/inventory_items/13.png" width="16" > iron. The difference between them is the time of biting.
  On average, a bite will occur on a wooden rod in 30-40 seconds, while on an iron rod, it will take 20-30 seconds. However, in order to buy an iron rod, you should try and collect a lot of coins.

**Catch**

  The catch depends on the bait, that is, the better the bait, the better the catch. But not always the catch can pay off the bait, with some chance, a simple cheap fish can be caught.
  **There are **FIVE** types of catch:**
- <img src="https://github.com/Romikk23/FishingGame/blob/main/game/src/main/resources/textures/hud/inventory_items/12.png" width="16" > **Bluefish** is the cheapest fish, the payback is very small compared to the bait, if the bait is expensive, then there is no payback. At the beginning it will go to earn money.
- <img src="https://github.com/Romikk23/FishingGame/blob/main/game/src/main/resources/textures/hud/inventory_items/14.png" width="16" > **Tropical** fish is a slightly more expensive fish, also for the development of initial capital.
- <img src="https://github.com/Romikk23/FishingGame/blob/main/game/src/main/resources/textures/hud/inventory_items/16.png" width="16" > **Redfish** is a relatively expensive fish, and can pay off the bait well if you are lucky.
- <img src="https://github.com/Romikk23/FishingGame/blob/main/game/src/main/resources/textures/hud/inventory_items/15.png" width="16" > **Whale** is the most expensive fish, it falls with little chance, it is caught only on the last bait, but it can be sold very profitably.
- <img src="https://github.com/Romikk23/FishingGame/blob/main/game/src/main/resources/textures/hud/inventory_items/17.png" width="16" > **Chest** is a very rare catch, 1% chance, bites only on the last bait, but you can sell it very expensively.

**Bait**

  Bait can be bought on the market, the better the bait, the better the potential catch. Bait may not always pay off. You can both pay off the bait and lose on it.
  **There are FOUR types of baits:**
- <img src="https://github.com/Romikk23/FishingGame/blob/main/game/src/main/resources/textures/hud/inventory_items/11.png" width="16" > **Worm** is the cheapest and easiest bait, given once a day in the amount of 10 pcs. for start-up capital.
- <img src="https://github.com/Romikk23/FishingGame/blob/main/game/src/main/resources/textures/hud/inventory_items/20.png" width="16" > **Corn** is also a simple bait, nothing to describe.
- <img src="https://github.com/Romikk23/FishingGame/blob/main/game/src/main/resources/textures/hud/inventory_items/18.png" width="16" > **Green beetle** is a bait that can pay off well and opens up access to new types of fish.
- <img src="https://github.com/Romikk23/FishingGame/blob/main/game/src/main/resources/textures/hud/inventory_items/19.png" width="16" > **Blue beetle** is the best bait, but it is risky to catch it, because there is little chance of paying off, but if you are lucky, the payoff will be very solid.
