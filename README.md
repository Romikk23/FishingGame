In general, it is a simple fishing, where there is a rod with which you can go to the lake and catch fish there. At the beginning of the map there is a guide who will introduce you to the game. Next, you will need bait, which you can buy for coins or get if you survive the day and go to the lodge to sleep. The house is located in the lower left corner of the map. In the morning, someone will put a jar of worms under your door.
